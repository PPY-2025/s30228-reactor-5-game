        <h4>Reactor Control Room — Operational Directive 04-A</h4>
        <p>All personnel are required to adhere strictly to the following procedures.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Your identification badge must remain visible at all times. You are not irreplaceable.
            But your clearance is.</li>
          <li>Should internal temperature begin to rise, engage the designated coolant control on the
            main console.</li>
          <li>Increased core pressure must be addressed immediately. Utilize the pressure release valve
            on the console interface.</li>
          <li>The system will alert you of any faults or instabilities. Engage the appropriate repair protocol
            button without delay.</li>
          <li>If all measures fail - then, and only then, may you engage the red panic override.</li>
          <li>You're the last line. Follow the protocol. Good luck.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>All reactor interactions are logged. Noncompliance is not invisible.</p>

        <h2>LOG 019</h2>
        <p>Technician: M. Kovalsky</p>
        <p>Reactor stable today. Replaced coolant valve #7 again. That's the third time this month.
          They keep sending the same parts. Like spitting on a leak and calling it fixed.
          Management's idea of "preventive maintenance" is duct tape and denial.</p>

        <hr class="solid">

        <h2>LOG 024</h2>
        <p>Technician: E. Delgado</p>
        <p>Temperature spikes at 02:14. No reason. No warning. Just climbed.
          I used the button. It stopped.
          But I swear — I swear I heard something behind the console. Clicking. Like teeth.</p>

        <hr class="solid">

        <h2>LOG 031</h2>
        <p>Technician: Unknown</p>
        <p>[Entry was never officially logged. Found scrawled on back of inspection checklist.]
          Don't trust the system diagnostics. It tells you what it thinks you want to hear.
          Pressure "nominal"? Then why did the glass bend last night?
          I'm not crazy. I recorded it. But the footage is gone.
          It deletes what it doesn't like. Like them.</p>

        <hr class="solid">

        <h2>LOG 036</h2>
        <p>Technician: E. Delgado</p>
        <p>No one saw Kovalsky leave. No goodbye. No clearance log. Just gone.
          They said he transferred to Outpost V.
          Outpost V was decommissioned last winter.
          I checked. I CHECKED.
          I'm next, aren't I?</p>

        <hr class="solid">

        <h2>LOG 041</h2>
        <p>Technician: A. R.</p>
        <p>New recruit asked what the red button does. I told him, "It's your final prayer."
          He laughed.
          I didn't.
          …I think the reactor listens when we joke about it.</p>

        <h2>[REDACTED LOG]</h2>
        <p>
          they want us to babysit a monster in a metal crib
          feed it lies, pat its head when it screams
          this isn't a reactor
          it's a ritual
          and every time we press those buttons
          we tell it: we're still afraid.
